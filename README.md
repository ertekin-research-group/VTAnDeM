The Visualization Toolkit for Analyzing Defects in Materials (VTAnDeM)
=======

VTAnDeM (Visualization Toolkit for Analyzing Defects in Materials) is a post-processing plotting toolkit for DFT calculations 
of defects in semiconductors. For given materials, the script imports DFT data provided by users, and produces phase stability 
diagram, defect diagrams at different chemical environments, and carrier concentrations. 


Getting Started
---------------
- Use the necessary scripts in `extract_data` to obtain a VTAnDeM-readable CSV file
- Place the generated `Compounds_Tracker.csv`, `Defects_Tracker.csv`, and `plot_defect.py` files in the same directory and call the latter script
- Choose two elements (First and Second Species) as the axis of phase diagram
- Press the ‘Generate Plot!’ button, use slide bar on the bottom to change chemical environment
- Click anywhere on the phase diagram (a red dot should appear)
- Press ‘Defect Diagram’ Button
- Choose different points in the phase diagram to explore defect contributions


User-provided data input:
-------------------------
DFT calculation results (POSCARs and OUTCARs) for: 
-	bulk chemical constituents;
-	competing compounds;
-	main compound.
generated by:
-	scf calculation for bulk and defect structures.
